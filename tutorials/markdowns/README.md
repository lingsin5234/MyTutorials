# My Tutorials

All my tutorials stored in Markdown files displayed on my website.

I have Wiki pages on my GitLab profile under different projects and wanted to consolidate them to one location. Thus,
the [Tutorials](/tutorials/list-tutorials) page allows me to search for the tutorial that I need more quickly.
